# Easy Rolls

## Ingredients
* 4 cups flour
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp + 1 tsp yeast
* 1 cup milk
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/4 cup butter

# Directions
1. Put the milk, water and butter together in a glass measuring cup and microwave for 30-45 seconds. Put the liquid in the bread maker.
2. Put the flour on top, then the sugar and salt. 
3. Make a well in the center and put in the yeast. 
4. Use the dough setting. After a minute or two check to make sure all the flour is incorporated. If not, scrape the sides. 
5. I usually only leave it about 50-60 minutes. It raised fast. 
6. Flour a cookie sheet and pat the dough gently about an inch thick. 
7. Use a biscuit cutter and arrange in a pie pan. Probably you will need 2-3. Spray the pan with nonstick spray first and spray the tops of the rolls. 
8. Let them rise 15-20 minutes.
9. Bake at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes. 
10. Spray the tops again after taking out of the oven. It will help them not to dry out.
